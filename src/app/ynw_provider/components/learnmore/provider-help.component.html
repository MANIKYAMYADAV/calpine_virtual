                                by default all the patients will get 10 minutes of waiting time.) Manual time should be
                                used when a doctor can guarantee to serve all the patients in the given time. To do so,
                                it is advisable that the doctor is equipped with enough resources. An additional option

                                on a monthly basis i.e. on 10th of each month. In case, the provider buys add-on and
                                Jaldee-keywords on a
                                different date (suppose on 20th January), the first bill of the add-on and

                                will be
                                calculated from 20 January - 10 February. After that, the same “10↔10” bill cycle will
                                continue from
                                next month. This billing cycle will include License and Addon amount in a single invoice
                                until the
                                license or Add-on gets upgraded/downgraded.<br><br>

                                default all the clients will get 10 minutes of waiting time.) Manual time should be used
                                when a provider can guarantee to serve all the clients in the given time. To do so, it
                                is

                                any

                        <span>Working Hours simply means the active time of the business. One can add multiple Working
                            Hours
                            according to the business schedule. To understand this with an example, suppose a business
                            works
                            from Monday to Friday (9 am to 5 pm) whereas, on Weekends (i.e. Saturday and Sunday), it
                            operates only for 4 hours (9 am to 1 pm). In such cases, one can create two working hours,
                            one
                            for weekdays and the other one for the Weekends.</span>

                                applied to all the check-ins (for example, If a provider sets 10 minutes of manual time,
                                by
                                default all the customers will get 10 minutes of waiting time.) Manual time should be
                                used
                                when a provider can guarantee to serve all the customers in the given time. To do so, it
                                is
                                advisable that the service provider is equipped with enough resources. An additional

                                provider chooses this option, then all the customers will receive and see a token number
                                instead of any waiting time.</li>
                            <li><strong>No Token :</strong> If a service provider chooses this option, the customers

                                be able to see the waiting time as well as the token number. Here a customer can see the

                        <span>Working Hours simply means the active time of the business. One can add multiple Working
                            Hours
                            according to the business schedule. To understand this with an example, suppose a business
                            works
                            from Monday to Friday (9 am to 5 pm) whereas, on Weekends (i.e. Saturday and Sunday), it
                            operates only for 4 hours (9 am to 1 pm). In such cases, one can create two working hours,
                            one
                            for weekdays and the other one for the Weekends.</span>

                        <span>Working Hours simply means the active time of the business. One can add multiple Working
                            Hours
                            according to the business schedule. To understand this with an example, suppose a business
                            works
                            from Monday to Friday (9 am to 5 pm) whereas, on Weekends (i.e. Saturday and Sunday), it
                            operates only for 4 hours (9 am to 1 pm). In such cases, one can create two working hours,
                            one
                            for weekdays and the other one for the Weekends.</span>

                        <span>Waiting time simply refers to the time a customer has to wait before he/she can avail the

                                applied to all the check-ins (for example, If a doctor sets 10 minutes of manual time,
                                by
                                default all the customers will get 10 minutes of waiting time.) Manual time should be
                                used
                                when a doctor can guarantee to serve all the customers in the given time. To do so, it

                                advisable that the doctor is equipped with enough resources. An additional option is
                                available for doctors choosing “Manual” wait time calculation. He/She can edit

                                this option, then all the customers will receive and see a token number instead of any
