        <li>A doctor is required to click on the “TURN ON” button to enable the Public Search if he/she wants to be
            visible in the patient’s search results.</li>
        <li>If a doctor has disabled the Public Search, patients cannot see the doctor’s profile in
            their search results.</li>
        <li>Patients can search for a doctor with any attributes that are listed under the Profile and Search section.
            These attributes can include the business name, Jaldee verified levels,
            Jaldee-Keyword, Basic Information, Location, Location Amenities, Specialization, Languages Known, Additional
            Info.</li>
        <li>Even if a doctor turns Public Search to off, patients can check-in with the same doctor from their
            “Favourites” (if already added doctor to Favourites List) list or using custom url.</li>
        <li>During the initial profile setup, a doctor can proceed with setting the Profile Name & Summary,
            Location, Working Hours, Service and Public Search status. The doctor can setup or update these
            informations here.

    <span>Working Hours simply means the active time of the business. One can add multiple Working
        Hours according to the business schedule. To understand this with an example, suppose a
        business works from Monday to Friday (9 am to 5 pm) whereas, on Weekends (i.e. Saturday and
        Sunday), it operates only for 4 hours (9 am to 1 pm). In such cases, one can create two
        working hours, one for weekdays and the other one for the Weekends.</span>

                    <li>When the doctor clicks on the <strong>“Upgrade License”</strong> button, a window

                        where a drop-down menu is listed with the available license packages.</li>

                    <li>A doctor can also upgrade the license package using the below links from dashboard:

                        date.</li>
                    <li>An invoice is generated on a monthly basis.</li>
                    <li>For example, if a doctor has created a profile on 10th January then all invoices will be
                        generated on a monthly basis i.e. on 10th of each month. In case, the doctor buys add-on
                        and
                        Jaldee-keywords on a different date (suppose on 20th January), the first bill of the
                        add-on
                        and Jaldee-keywords will be calculated from 20 January - 10 February. After that, the
                        same
                        “10↔10” bill cycle will continue from next month. This billing cycle will include
                        License
                        and Addon amount in a single invoice until the license or Add-on gets
                        upgraded/downgraded.<br><br>

        <li><strong>Percentage: </strong> A specific percentage of the total amount from the invoice

    <h6 id="tax-settings">Tax Settings</h6>
    <span>Before setting up the taxes, ensure that one is familiar with the tax requirements of
        one’s
        business. The following instructions will help the doctor through the tax setup of the
        business
        services in Jaldee:</span>
    <ul ol class="ol-normal">
        <li>When the doctor clicks on the tax settings under the Billing/PoS section, a window
            appears.
            The doctor is required to fill the textbox (Enter the GST number of the business and the
            tax
            percentage for the respective sector here).</li>
        <li>At first, enter the <strong>GST</strong> number of the business.</li>
        <li>Next, enter the <strong>Tax Percentage.</strong></li>
        <li>After the complete insertion of the details, click <strong>“Save”.</strong></li>
        <li>This tax will be applied to the services offered and the items that are being sold at
            the
            time of billing, only if the <strong>“Tax Applicable”</strong> toggle button is enabled
            in
            the respective section (i.e. Settings -> Check-in Manager ->Services).</li>
        <li>Jaldee has no role in paying taxes paid by the patient to the doctor. All types of taxes
            are
            collected directly by the doctor, so it is the doctor’s responsibility to remit the
            taxes to
            the Government.</li>
