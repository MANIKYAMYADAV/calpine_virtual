        <li>A provider is required to click on the “TURN ON” button to enable the Public Search if
            he/she wants to be visible in the customer’s search results.</li>
        <li>If a provider has disabled the Public Search, customers cannot see the provider’s
            profile in
            their search results.</li>
        <li>Customers can search for a provider with any attributes that are listed under the
            Profile
            and Search section. These attributes can include the business name, Jaldee verified
            levels,
            Jaldee-keyword, Basic Information, Location, Location Amenities, Specialization,
            Languages

        <li>During the initial profile setup, a provider can proceed with setting the Profile Name &
            Summary, Location, Working Hours, Service and Public Search status. The provider can
            setup
            or update these informations here.

                    not be active. To activate the account, the provider has to completely fill
                    basic
                    details and turn on the Public Search. At this point, a default service gets
                    created
                    which can be edited in <strong>Services</strong> under the Check-In Manager.

            on
            the <strong>“Profile”</strong> under <strong>Settings</strong> and enter the details.
            Once
            done, set Public Search to <strong>“ON”.</strong></li>
        <li>Afterwards, a provider can enable <strong>“Online Check-in”.</strong></li>
        <li>Provider can choose two options:

    <h6><u>Calculation of waiting time</u></h6>
    <span>Waiting time simply refers to the time a customer has to wait before he/she can avail the
        services offered at the premise.</span>
    <ul class="ul-normal">
        <li><strong>Automatic (Machine Learning) :</strong> Using a machine learning algorithm, the
            system automatically calculates the turnaround time for each service by analyzing a
            provider’s service history.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual :</strong> Using this option, a provider can fix a wait time which will
            be
            applied to all the check-ins (for example, If a provider sets 10 minutes of manual time,
            by
            default all the customers will get 10 minutes of waiting time.) Manual time should be
            used
            when a provider can guarantee to serve all the customers in the given time. To do so, it
            is
            advisable that the service provider is equipped with enough resources. An additional
            option
            is available for providers choosing “Manual” wait time calculation. He/She can edit
            individual check-ins wait time from the check-in details in provider dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Token System(Do not show waiting time for customers) :</strong> If a service
            provider chooses this option, then all the customers will receive and see a token number
            instead of any waiting time.</li>
        <li><strong>No Token :</strong> If a service provider chooses this option, the customers
            won’t
            be able to see the waiting time as well as the token number. Here a customer can see the
            number of persons ahead of him/her.</li>

                            the premise of the business location to avail the services. When a

                            name of the customer. In case of a walk-in or kiosk customer, the

                            <strong>“Started”</strong> tab. This will lead to the activation of the
                            other two buttons, namely, <strong>“Complete”</strong> and
                            <strong>“Bill”</strong>. Click on these buttons as and when required.

                            Here a provider can add extra services or items in the bill. From the

    <h6 id="tax-settings">Tax Settings</h6>
    <span>Before setting up the taxes, ensure that one is familiar with the tax requirements of
        one’s
        business. The following instructions will help the provider through the tax setup of the
        business services in Jaldee:</span>
    <ul ol class="ol-normal">
        <li>When the provider clicks on the tax settings under the Billing/PoS section, a window
            appears. The provider is required to fill the textbox (Enter the GST number of the
            business
            and the tax percentage for the respective sector here).</li>
        <li>At first, enter the <strong>GST</strong> number of the business.</li>
        <li>Next, enter the <strong>Tax Percentage</strong>.</li>
        <li>After the complete insertion of the details, click <strong>“Save”.</strong></li>
        <li>This tax will be applied to the services offered and the items that are being sold at
            the
            time of billing, only if the <strong>“Tax Applicable”</strong> toggle button is enabled
            in
            the respective section (i.e. Settings -> Check-In Manager ->Services).</li>
        <li>Jaldee has no role in paying taxes paid by the customer to the service provider. All
            types
            of taxes are collected directly by the service provider, so it is the provider’s
            responsibility to remit the taxes to the Government.</li>
