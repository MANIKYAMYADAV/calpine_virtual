              <h4>How it works?</h4>
              <p>The <strong>KIOSK</strong> feature is designed for walk-in customers. With this feature, the walk-in customers can self-check-in for the services, sign up to Jaldee and view the status of the check-in.</p>
              <ol class="ol-normal">
                  <li><strong><u>Check-In Yourself</u></strong></li>
                  <p>A customer can walk-in to any open Kiosk. The Kiosk prompts the customer to enter the mobile number and the first three letters of their first name/last name. This is to look up if the customer is already registered with <strong>Jaldee</strong>.</p>
                  <ul class="ul-normal abc">
                      <li>If the customer is already a registered member, he/she can check-in online for the offered services.</li>
                      <li>If the customer is not a registered member, he/she can register with Jaldee. To do so, the customer has to input his/her name and then he/she can proceed with the check-in process.</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <ul class="ul-normal">
                      <li>In the check-in window, first, select the service from the drop-down menu. If the doctor has only one default service, then there will be no drop-down menu.</li>
                      <li>Check-in window has a feature to add or change a family member for whom the customer wishes to do the check-in. To do so, click <strong>“Add/Change Member”</strong>. In case the member is already added in the list, the customer can search for the member with the first and last name.</li>
                      <li>A customer has the option to add a note if any. To do so, click <strong>“If you have a note, Click here (+)”</strong> and write the message in the textbox.</li>
                      <li>With all this information, a customer can proceed with the check-in by clicking on the <strong>“Confirm Check-in”</strong>.</li>
                      <li>At the time of completion of the check-in process through the Kiosk, the status of check-in changes to <strong>“Arrived”</strong>.</li>
                      <li>Push notification regarding the completion of the check-in process is sent to the customer’s registered mobile number.</li>
                      <li>Future Check-in is done in the same way as that of normal check-in. The only difference here in Future check-in is to select the date.</li>
                      <p>Note: A customer is restricted only to the above-mentioned information. The customer cannot access any other information about the service doctor’s Jaldee account. </p>

                  <li><strong><u>Checked-in Online Check Your Status/Report as Arrived</u></strong></li>
                  <ul class="ul-normal">
                      <li>A customer (who has already checked-in online) can view the status of the check-in by entering the mobile number and name.</li>
                      <li>The window shows the status of the customer’s check-in along with the estimated waiting time or token number with persons ahead. If the customer has arrived at the business premise, he/she can mark their status to Arrived by clicking on the <strong>“Confirm Arrival”</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <li><strong><u>Do You Want to Sign Up?</u></strong></li>
                  <p>The customers can sign up to Jaldee through the KIOSK machine under this option. To do so, simply enter the mobile number, first name, and last name. This will get the customer registered with Jaldee.</p>
                  <ul class="ul-normal">
                          <li>A customer can also register themselves with Jaldee and proceed with the check-in.</li>
                          <li>The initial step is the search process. With the mobile number and first name/last name of the customer, one can search the Jaldee database for the customer’s existence in the record.</li>
