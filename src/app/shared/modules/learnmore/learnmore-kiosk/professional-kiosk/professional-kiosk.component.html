    KIOSK

Jaldee Kiosk feature allows you to place a Tablet/PC/Laptop/Other Machines in your premise to give your customers an easier and more interactive way to check-in themselves for the services offered by your enterprise.

How it works?

The KIOSK feature is designed to allow the walk-in clients to self check-in for the services offered by your enterprise.

Check-In Yourself
Client can walk-in to any open Kiosk. The kiosk will prompt the client to enter the mobile number and first three letters of their first name or last name. This is to look up if the client is already been registered with Jaldee.
If the client is already a registered member, he/she can check-in online for any service offered.
If the client is not a registered member, he/she can register with Jaldee inputting name and can proceed with check-in.
In check-in window first select the service you wish to avail from the drop down menu. If the provider has only one default service there will be no drop down menu.
Check-in window has a feature to add or change a family member whom you wish to do check-in for. Click “Add/Change Member” to add new member with first name and last name and also can choose member from the list of members added already.
If you need to communicate with the provider you can click “If you have a note, Click here(+)” and can write the message in the textbox.
With this information you are ready to proceed with online check-in by clicking “CONFIRM CHECK-IN”.
Push message will be sent to client’s mobile number.
Alike Check-in, Future Check-in can be done in the same way. The only difference is that you need to select the date of check-in here.

Note: Other than above client cannot access any other information of your jaldee account.



Checked-in Online Check Your Status/Report as Arrived
	
Clients who have checked-in online can search for their status inputting mobile number and name. 
The window shows the status of their check-in along with the token number, persons ahead, estimated waiting time. If he/she has arrived they can mark their status to Arrived clicking “CONFIRM ARRIVAL”.
A customer can also get registered with Jaldee by themselves and can proceed with check-in.
Initial step is the search process. With mobile number and first name/last name of  client, search for this particular entry in the system.
If the client does not exists, he/she can input the client details and get registered with Jaldee.
