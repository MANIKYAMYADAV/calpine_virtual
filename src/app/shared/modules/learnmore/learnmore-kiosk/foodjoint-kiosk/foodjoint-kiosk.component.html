    KIOSK

Jaldee Kiosk feature allows you to place a Tablet/PC/Laptop/Other Machines in your premise to give your customers an easier and more interactive way to check-in themselves for the services offered by your enterprise.

How it works?

The KIOSK feature is designed to allow the walk-in customers to self check-in for the services offered by your enterprise.

Check-In Yourself
Customer can walk-in to any open Kiosk. The kiosk will prompt the customer to enter the mobile number and first three letters of their first name or last name. This is to look up if the customer is already been registered with Jaldee.
If the customer is already a registered member, he/she can check-in online for any service offered.
If the customer is not a registered member, he/she can register with Jaldee inputting name and can proceed with check-in.
In check-in window first select the service you wish to avail from the drop down menu. If the provider has only one default service there will be no drop down menu.
Check-in window has a feature to add or change a family member whom you wish to do check-in for. Click “Add/Change Member” to add new member with first name and last name and also can choose member from the list of members added already.
Enter the party size to proceed with check-in.
If you need to communicate with the provider you can click “If you have a note, Click here(+)” and can write the message in the textbox.
With this information you are ready to proceed with online check-in by clicking “CONFIRM CHECK-IN”.
Push message will be sent to customers mobile number.
Alike Check-in, Future Check-in can be done in the same way. The only difference is that you need to select the date of check-in here.

Note: Other than above customer cannot access any other information of your jaldee account.
