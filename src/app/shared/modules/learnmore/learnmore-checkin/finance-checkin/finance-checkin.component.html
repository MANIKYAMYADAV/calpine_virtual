                 <li>A provider can create and check-in a customer for service.</li>
                 <li>To search for a customer and to check whether he/she has already been registered with Jaldee, the provider can use the customer’s mobile number, his/her first name/last name.</li>
                 <li>In case, the customer’s data does not exist in the Jaldee database, the provider can input the details of the customer and get him/her registered with Jaldee.com.</li>
             </ul>
         
 
 <div class="box-indent">
     <ul class="ul-normal">
         <li>In the check-in/get token window, first, select the service from the drop-down menu that a customer wishes to avail. In case, the provider has only one default service, then there will be no drop-down menu.</li>
         <li>Check-in/Get Token window has a feature to add or change a family member whom the customer wishes to do a check-in for. Click “Add/Change Member” to add a new member with the first name and the last name. In case the family member is already added, it can be directly selected from the list of members.</li>
         <li>If a customer has any note, the provider can click <strong>“If you have a note, Click here (+)”</strong> to write the message in the textbox.</li>
         <li>With all this information the provider can now proceed with the check-in process of  the walk-in customer by clicking on <strong>“Confirm Check-in".</strong></li>
         <li>Push message will be sent to the customer’s mobile and an email notification to the registered email address regarding the information of check-in.</li>
         <li>Future Check-in can be done in the same way as that of Check-in. The only difference between these check-ins is that the provider needs to select a date of check-ins in the Future Check-in.</li>
