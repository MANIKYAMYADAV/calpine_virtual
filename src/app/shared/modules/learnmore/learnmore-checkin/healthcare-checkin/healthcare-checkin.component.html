                       <li>To search for a patient and to check whether he/she has already been registered with Jaldee, the doctor can use the patient’s mobile number, his/her first name/last name.</li>
                       <li>In case, the patient’s data does not exist in the Jaldee database, the doctor can input the details of the patient and get him/her registered with Jaldee.com.

               <li>In the check-in/get token window, first, select the service from the drop-down menu that a patient wishes to avail. In case, the doctor has only one default service, then there will be no drop-down menu.</li>
               <li>Check-in/Get Token window has a feature to add or change a family member whom the patient wishes to do a check-in for. Click “Add/Change Member” to add a new member with the first name and the last name. In case the family member is already added, it can be directly selected from the list of members.</li>
               <li>If a patient has any note, the doctor can click <strong>“If you have a note, Click here (+)”</strong> to write the message in the textbox.</li>
               <li>With all this information the doctor can now proceed with the check-in process of the walk-in patient by clicking on <strong>“Confirm Check-in".</strong></li>
               <li>Push message will be sent to the patient’s mobile and an email notification to the registered email address regarding the information of check-in.</li>
               <li>Future Check-in can be done in the same way as that of Check-in. The only difference between these check-ins is that the doctor needs to select a date of check-ins in the Future Check-in.</li>
