                   <li>A priest can create and check-in a devotee for service.</li>
                   <li>To search for a devotee and to check whether he/she has already been registered with Jaldee, the priest can use the devotee’s mobile number, his/her first name/last name.</li>
                   <li>In case, the devotee’s data does not exist in the Jaldee database, the priest can input the details of the devotee and get him/her registered with Jaldee.com.</li>

           <li>In the check-in/get token window, first, select the service from the drop-down menu that a devotee wishes to avail. In case, the priest has only one default service, then there will be no drop-down menu.</li>
           <li>Check-in/Get Token window has a feature to add or change a family member whom the devotee wishes to do a check-in for. Click “Add/Change Member” to add a new member with the first name and the last name. In case the family member is already added, it can be directly selected from the list of members.</li>
           <li><strong>Multiple persons can be selected from Add/Change member to proceed with a single check-in.</strong></li>
           <li>If a devotee has any note, the priest can click <strong>“If you have a note, Click here (+)” to write the message in the textbox.</strong></li>
           <li>With all this information the priest can now proceed with the check-in process of  the walk-in devotee by clicking on <strong>“Confirm Check-in”.</strong></li>
           <li>Push message will be sent to the devotee’s mobile and an email notification to the registered email address regarding the information of check-in.</li>
           <li>Future Check-in can be done in the same way as that of Check-in. The only difference between these check-ins is that the priest needs to select a date of check-ins in the Future Check-in.</li>
