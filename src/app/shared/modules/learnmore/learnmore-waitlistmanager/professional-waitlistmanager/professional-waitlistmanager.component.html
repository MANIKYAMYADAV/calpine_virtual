        <h4><u>Accept Online Check-in</u></h4>

        <ul class="ul-normal">
            <li>Here, a provider gets full control over online client check-in.</li>
            <li>Complete the <strong>“Profile & Summary”</strong> section with details. To do so, click on the <strong>“Profile”</strong> under <strong>Settings</strong> and enter the details. Once done, set Public Search to <strong>“ON”.</strong></li>
            <li>Afterward, a provider can enable <strong>“Online Check-in”.</strong></li>
            <li>Provider can choose two options:
                <ul class="ul-normal">
                    <li><strong>Same day check-in :</strong> Check this button to accept check-ins for the same day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Future check-in :</strong> Check this button to accept check-ins for a future date.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Walk-in check-ins are always enabled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><u>Calculation of waiting time</u></h4>
        <p>Waiting time simply refers to the time a client has to wait before he/she can avail the services offered at the premise.</p>
        <ul class="ul-normal">
            <li><strong>Automatic (Machine Learning) :</strong> Using a machine learning algorithm, the system automatically calculates the turnaround time for each service by analyzing a provider’s service history.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual :</strong> Using this option, a provider can fix a wait time which will be applied to all the check-ins (for example, If a provider sets 10 minutes of manual time, by default all the clients will get 10 minutes of waiting time.) Manual time should be used when a provider can guarantee to serve all the clients in the given time. To do so, it is advisable that the service provider is equipped with enough resources. An additional option is available for providers choosing “Manual” wait time calculation. He/She can edit individual check-ins wait time from the check-in details in provider dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Token System(Do not show waiting time for clients) :</strong> If a service provider chooses this option, then all the clients will receive and see a token number instead of any waiting time. </li>
            <li><strong>No Token :</strong> If a service provider chooses this option, the clients won’t be able to see the waiting time as well as the token number. Here a client can see the number of persons ahead of him/her.</li>
        </ul>
