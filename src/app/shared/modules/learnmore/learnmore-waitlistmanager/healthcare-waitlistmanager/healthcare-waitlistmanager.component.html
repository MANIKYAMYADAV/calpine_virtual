        <h4>ACCEPT ONLINE CHECK-IN</h4>

        <ul class="ul-normal">
            <li>This gives you full control over online patient check-in.</li>
            <li>First you have to complete “Profile & Summary” section under <strong>Profile & Search(Settings)</strong>
                and set Public search to <strong>“ON”</strong>.</li>
            <li>And then you can enable <strong>“Accept Online Check-In”</strong>.</li>
            <li>If this button is enabled, online check-in is open for patients and if this button is disabled,
                patients can only view your profile at their dashboard, but cannot check-in online for any services

            <h5>How is waiting time calculated ?</h5>
            <p>Waiting time refers to the time patient waits to avail his/her service offered at your enterprise.</p>

            <ul class="ul-normal">
                <li><strong>Automatic (Machine Learning) :</strong> Our system uses machine learning algorithm which
                    automatically calculates the turnaround time for each service by analysing provider’s service
                    history.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed :</strong> By selecting this option you can choose a fixed service time which will be
                    applied for all check-ins.(eg. If you set 10 mins of fixed time, by default all the patients will
                    get 10 mins of waiting time).
                    Fixed time can be used only when you guarantee to serve all patients in the given fixed time. You
                    should have enough resources to do the same.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Do not show waiting time for patients(Token Enabled) :</strong> If you enable this option,
                    no wait time will be shown to your patients, but token number will be shown.</li>
                <li><strong>Do not show waiting time for patients(Token Disabled) :</strong> If you enable this option,
                    neither wait time nor token number will be shown to your patients. But persons ahead is shown to
                    get an idea of your turn for actual appointment.</li>
