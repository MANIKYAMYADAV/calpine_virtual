      <p class = "adjust-delay-para">Billing/POS page is the one-stop-shop for adding items, discounts and coupons. Discounts and coupons play a key factor in driving clients towards a product/service and in boosting sales. <strong>Add item</strong> enables you to create and publish list of items you wish to sell at your premise. Jaldee also gives you the flexibility and ease of providing clients with discounts and coupons. Discount/Coupons can be redeemed to specific services/items and also to the total amount. You can set up two types of discounts/coupons in your Jaldee profile:</p>
               
          <ol class="ol-normal adjust-delay-num">
                <li><strong>Fixed Amount: </strong>This discount type will deduct the specified amount from either the total amount on the invoice or each specified item in the bill.</li>
                <li><strong>Percentage: </strong> This discount type will deduct the specified percentage of the total amount from the invoice. "Percentage" type discounts/coupons can however be applied either to the total amount on the invoice or each specified item in the bill.</li>
          </ol>
