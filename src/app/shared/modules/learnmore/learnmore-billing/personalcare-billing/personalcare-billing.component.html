    <ul class="ul-normal">
        <li>A provider can add/remove the item, service, discounts, and coupons anytime in the bill. The changes in the bill will be reflected immediately.</li>
        <li>A provider can settle the bill only after the full amount is paid (either by paying the full amount, or applying discount/coupon/on demand discount).</li>

    <div class="box-indent">
      <h5 id="items">Items</h5>
      <p class="adjust-delay-para">Under Items a provider can create and publish a list of items that are being sold at the premise. To add a new item, click <strong>“Add Item”.</strong> A new window appears where the provider can insert the information regarding the item such as its name, price, a short description, and a detailed description. If the item is taxable, the provider is required to enable the <strong>“Taxable”</strong> toggle button (the percentage of tax can be set in <strong>tax settings</strong>). This can be enabled only if the <strong>Tax settings</strong> is already set. Click <strong>“Submit”</strong> when all the information is filled. The provider can always change the quantity of the service or item in the bill. The changes will be reflected right away in the bill. <strong>This is only available from Platinum License package.</strong></p>
      
      <h5 id="discount">Discounts</h5>
      <p class="adjust-delay-para">To add a discount for the first time, click <strong>“Discounts”.</strong> Here the provider needs to enter the discount name, its type (Percentage/Fixed), and provide a description to the discount along with the value in Rupees. The discounts can be applied to the total bill as well as to each item and service.  A provider can set up two types of Discounts:</p>
      <ol class="ol-normal adjust-delay-num">
          <li><strong>Fixed Amount: </strong> A specified amount will be deducted from either the total amount or from each specified item/service in the bill.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentage: </strong> A specific percentage of the total amount from the invoice or from each item will be deducted in this case. <strong>“Percentage”</strong> type discounts can be applied either to the total amount on the invoice or to each specified item/service in the bill.
          </li>
        </ol>
      <p class="adjust-delay-para">The discount dashboard shows all the existing discounts that have been created in Jaldee settings. Discount name, value, and description of each discount is visible here. A provider can create, delete and edit the discount. For creating more discounts, click on <strong>“(+)”</strong> symbol.</p>
      <p class="adjust-delay-para">* Note: <strong>On Demand Discount</strong> is created during the account creation and its price is set to zero by default. It can only be applied to the total bill. It can be viewed under discounts list, right after the account creation. Its price cannot be updated. It can be used to waive the bill amount.  At the time of bill updation, the provider can give any amount of on-demand discount by selecting this discount.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="tax-settings">Tax Settings</h4>
        <p>Before setting up the taxes, ensure that one is familiar with the tax requirements of one’s business. The following instructions will help the provider through the tax setup of the business services in Jaldee:</p>
          <ul ol class="ol-normal"> 
            <li>When the provider clicks on the tax settings under the Billing/PoS section, a window appears. The provider is required to fill the textbox (Enter the GST number of the business and the tax percentage for the respective sector here).</li>
            <li>At first, enter the <strong>GST</strong> number of the business.</li>
            <li>Next, enter the <strong>Tax Percentage</strong>.</li>
            <li>After the complete insertion of the details, click <strong>“Save”.</strong></li>
            <li>This tax will be applied to the services offered and the items that are being sold at the time of billing, only if the <strong>“Tax Applicable”</strong> toggle button is enabled in the respective section (i.e. Settings -> Check-in Manager ->Services).</li>
            <li>Jaldee has no role in paying taxes paid by the customer to the service provider. All types of taxes are collected directly by the service provider, so it is the provider’s responsibility to remit the taxes to the Government.</li>
